# Objects Directory

Put your digital collection items' files in this folder!
By default, the CollectionBuilder-GH template looks for collection objects in this folder. 

Many common file types are supported (for example, .jpg, .pdf, and .mp3). 

**Guidelines:**

- File size: since there are no thumbnails generated, keep your object files at a reasonable size for access on the web. This means you will usually not be using your full resolution versions! For example, jpeg images of about 1200px wide and PDFs less than 1 MB will work well. Larger objects (especially images) will slow load times and make your users download unnecessarily large data--so keep them to a web friendly size!
- Total size: GitHub repositories have soft limits on total size, some where around 1 GB. A good rule of thumb is to keep your "objects" folder less than 500 MB. 
- Filenaming: to avoid issues, please pay close attention to filenaming conventions! The filename should be an all lowercase unique string with no spaces or special characters. Underscores (`_`) are okay. You will use the exact filenames to populate the "filename" field of your collection metadata.
